The analysis reveals significant regional disparities in crimes against women across the top 10 states in India from 2001 to 2021. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal exhibit the highest average numbers of domestic violence and assault, indicating critical areas for targeted intervention. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh show substantial averages in rape cases and kidnapping, suggesting a need for enhanced protective measures. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh's high averages of dowry deaths highlight persistent dowry-related violence. These insights underscore the necessity for state-specific strategies and policies to effectively combat and reduce various forms of violence against women. Additionally, there is a pressing need to bring solutions and education focused on boys and young men to foster respect and equality towards women.
